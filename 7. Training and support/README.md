# 7. Training and support

## Training

This can be done in a more official organised basis or adhoc. The best way to look for all training material that might have been written by people in DASD is to search our github for the topic "training" ([link with prefilled search here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services?q=topic%3Atraining&type=&language=)).

Some examples of training can be found here:
- git/GitHub training for DASD ([here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/git-training-class))
- SQL training for DASD ([here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/sql_training))
- R training ([here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/IntroRTraining))
- Python training ([intro](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding/tree/master/2019-09-03%20intro%20into%20python)) and ([pandas intro](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding/tree/master/2019-10-15_intro%20to%20pandas))

We also run Coffee and Coding sessions which are often mini-training sessions or introductions into a tool or topic. The coffee and coding sessions are in [this repo](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding) where each folder is a session that was ran.

## Support

There are many different routes to get support for the Analytical Platform and the tools that are included within the platform. The first and main support page is the [analytical platform guidance](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/#content). Failing that when people have issues or questions about the AP and tools we have multiple slack channels (on `asdslack`) where users can post requests or questions on these are:

- `#analytical_platform`: when these is a problem with the tools on the analytical platform and you may need a developer to jump in a force reset or delete something, etc.
- `#ap_admin_request`: to perform actions that only admins can do. These include moving access to another member of staff when the original owner has left, create deploy an app for the first time, etc. The full list of these actions are referenced in the platform guidance
- `#data_engineers`: To ask questions about Airflow (our tool to schedule/automate data pipelines), database access requests, or general questions about the tools and services the data engineers cover.
- `#r`: Questions about the programming language R.
- `#intro_r`: Really basic questions and a "no stupid question ethos" for the programming language R.
- `#python`: Questions about the programming language Python.
- `#git`: Questions about how to use git and Github.
