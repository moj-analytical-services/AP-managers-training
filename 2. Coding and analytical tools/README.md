# 2. Coding and analytical tools

### Tools available

We have two key analytical tools on the AP: RStudio (for coding in R) and JupyterLab (for coding in Python). Coupled with the platformâ€™s data storage capability, completing analysis in code allows work to be more reproducible, easily sharable and less error-prone.

#### TL;DR

* R is a statistical language and is best used for building stats models, data visualisation and can be used for reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP). 
* Python is a general purpose language and is best used for machine learning, analytics, data visualisation and data pipelines.
* In general both languages can be used for most things. All else being equal we recommend Python, but choose whichever language you/your team feel comfortable with.

#### RStudio

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, which makes coding in R easier and more efficient for users. R is now commonly used across the department (and across government and beyond) for creating statistical models, data analysis and reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP). Being completely open source means that it now has a vast array of packages covering things from data visualisation and dashboards to data wrangling and machine learning. A good collection can be found in the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). In addition, the platform can host [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboards, one of many ways of sharing results from analysis in R with customers.

For examples of some of the completed and ongoing R projects in DASD see [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type=public&language=r). 

#### JupyterLab

Python is a general purpose programming language. JupyterLab allows platform users to code and create notebooks in Python. Python is an extremely versatile language. It has been used in the department for our data infrastructure and pipelines, as well as for machine learning and data analytics thanks to a vast number of top-notch plugins and libraries. Examples of commonly used libraries include [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Python is easy to read and has quite a shallow learning curve so is beginner-friendly.

#### So which one: R or Python?

If you Google [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=r+vs+python) you will find many articles arguing one way or the other. However, most work that we do in DASD can be completed in either language. All else being equal we recommend Python, as it is more versatile and slightly easier to learn. However, consider if there are analysts in your team who are already proficient at one or the other; they will be useful when others are learning. For a specific project, have a search around to see if there are packages that make what you want to do easier. There is a lot of support for both languages online and within government.

### Resources for learning

More specific training can be found in [Chapter 7](Add link), but there are many free online courses for learning the basics of R and Python, as well as common packages.
